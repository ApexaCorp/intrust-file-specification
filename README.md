# In-Trust File Specification

This describes the data format that APEXA can load into the In-Trust environment.

## Required Fields

Many fields are labeled as required, but please consider these fields to be a "soft" requirement.  If you do not store a required field, please leave it empty: do not manufacture data just to fill the field.  Where applicable, the file format specification indicates the default value we will use if no value is provided.
